# 🚀 Full CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker & AWS EC2

This project demonstrates the implementation of a fully automated **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)** pipeline using:

- ✅ **GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- ⚙️ **GitHub Actions** for automation  
- 📦 **Docker** for containerization  
- ☁️ **AWS EC2** as the deployment server

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase a complete DevOps workflow, where code is collaboratively developed, continuously integrated, and automatically deployed to a live server with zero manual intervention.

---

## 👥 Team Collaboration (Branch Strategy)

- The team consisted of **4 members**.
- Each developer worked on a **dedicated Git branch** for individual features or modules.
- Branches were periodically merged into the **`main`** branch using **pull requests**.
- GitHub’s built-in **code review and merge checks** ensured a clean and conflict-free integration process.

This structure enabled parallel development and frequent integration, aligning with CI best practices.

---

## 🔁 Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration was implemented using GitHub’s branching and pull request workflow:

- Developers pushed changes to feature branches.
- Pull requests triggered review and testing steps.
- Code was integrated into the `main` branch only after successful validation.

---

## ⚙️ Continuous Delivery (CD) with GitHub Actions

A **GitHub Actions workflow** was configured to automate the delivery process:

1. **Trigger:** Any push to the `main` branch.
2. **Build:** Pull the latest code and build a Docker image.
3. **Deploy:**
   - Establish an SSH connection to an **AWS EC2** instance.
   - Stop and remove any existing containers.
   - Deploy the new Docker container with the updated application.

This pipeline ensures that the application is automatically updated on the server without manual steps.

---

## 📦 Docker Containerization

Docker is used to create a production-ready container for the application:

- Environment-independent setup
- Consistent builds
- Easy rollback and redeployment
- Eliminates "works on my machine" issues

---

## ☁️ Deployment on AWS EC2

The final deployment step involves hosting the Docker container on an **Amazon EC2** instance:

- The workflow script uses SSH keys to securely access the server.
- The updated container replaces the old one on every push to `main`.
- The server always runs the latest version of the app.

---

## 🔐 Security Measures

- SSH key-based authentication for EC2.
- Docker images are built and pulled only from trusted branches.
- Workflow secrets (e.g., private keys) are stored securely in GitHub Secrets.

---

## 📈 Benefits of this CI/CD Pipeline

- Faster and reliable deployment
- No downtime updates
- Consistent and isolated environments with Docker
- Full traceability of deployments via GitHub Actions logs
- Easy collaboration and code integration
